        <div class="post-content">
          <p>One of the very common architectural patterns is <em>fan-out</em> where an event is sent to multiple subscribers by a broker. An event can be like placing an order, which can then be handled by inventory service, record-keeping, as well as shipping service concurrently. These events can also be very frequent - like clickstreams, or search strings on a website. AWS allows for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SNS_Scenarios.html">fan-out architecture</a> with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/">SNS</a> topics, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">SQS</a> queues. SQS queue(s) can subscribe to SNS topics and receive any message sent to the SNS topic(s). It is documented that <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html">FIFO queues</a> cannot be SNS subscribers <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=246962">here</a>.</p>

<p>However, as I recently found out, SSE-enabled SQS queues cannot subscribe to SNS either. While AWS stops us from subscribing a FIFO queue to SNS, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-server-side-encryption-for-amazon-simple-queue-service-sqs/">SSE-enabled queues</a> are allowed to subscribe, but they never get any events. The purpose of this post is to document this previously undocumented behavior.</p>

          <p>Its a challenge to log messages with a Lambda, given that there is no server to run the agents or forwarders (splunk, filebeat, etc.) on. Here is a quick and easy tutorial to set up <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products">ELK</a> logging by writing directly to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">logstash</a> via the <a href="https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder">TCP appender</a> and logback.

<p>Serverless is a node.js based framework that makes creating, deploying, and managing serverless functions a breeze. We will use AWS Lambda as our FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) provider, although Serverless supports IBM OpenWhisk and Microsoft Azure as well.</p>

<p>In this session, we will talk about Serverless Applications, and Create and deploy a java-maven based AWS Lambda API. We will also explore the command line interface to manage lambda, which is provided out of the box by serverless framework.</p>

          <p>Every service needs encryption at one point or another - passwords to the database, credentials to an external service, or even entire filesystem or files. Sticking the secrets, or keys in configuration files seems a quick and easy option. However, it carries security risks, even if these configurations are managed outside of the source code. On top of it, the keys used to encrypt/decrypt the data bring additional security implications and requirements in terms of storage, audit, and lifecycle management.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS KMS</a>, or AWS Key Management Service is a fully managed service to store and manage keys. Any AWS service which supports encryption - S3 buckets, EBS Volumes, SQS, etc. uses KMS under the hood. KMS is more than just a key manager, it can also be used to encrypt large volumes of data, using a technique called Envelope Encryption.</p>

<p>In this post I will cover KMS, and the <em>why</em>, <em>what</em>, and <em>how</em> of Envelope Encryption.</p>

          <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank_">Amazon ECS</a>, or EC2 Container Service is a Container Management Service for Docker containers. Similar to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank_">Kubernetes</a> in intent, the service allows users to provision Docker containers in a fully managed cluster of EC2s. This post is a quick summary of how to get up and running with your own ECS cluster.</p>

<p>The motivation behind containers is to optimize the usage of underlying resources like CPU and Memory. Containerized infrastructure provides a dense compute environment, allowing us to pack more usage without having to spend $$ for idle/underutilized resources.</p>
