          <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/1068200715733020673">re:Invent 2018</a>, AWS announced <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda Layers</a>, bringing Lambda construct closer to that of an AMI. Put simply, layers are dependencies that can be made available to the function at runtime. Currently there can be 5 <em>layers</em> associated with a function. Layers help with isolating common dependencies, as well as keeping the runtime consistent in terms of versions - just like the AMIs do. Layers are immutable, and are versioned. While this post is focused on Python, the concept of layers applies uniformly regardless of the language (although I feel this is more <em>useful</em> for dynamic languages compared to languages like Java, where the whole artifact is packaged as a part of the deployment artifact). The dependencies are zipped up, uploaded as new layer, or a new version of an existing layer. They can be tied to runtimes (via labels) for validation as well.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll walk through creating a Python layer, and associating it with a function. I’ll use the CLI, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell">aws-shell</a> to accomplish this.</p>

          <p>My <a href="https://lobster1234.github.io/2016/10/29/aws-certification-notes/">CSAA from 2016</a> had expired, and I was in Vegas to attend <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">re:Invent 2018</a>. I took this opportunity to recertify the credential. This is a newer version of the exam, which made it exciting, but at the same time there were a lot of services that I had not really used, so had to go through the FAQs and documentation for those, along with the excellent <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">acloud.guru</a> course.</p>

<p>It took me about 4 days of serious prep, and I scored 927/1000. Working with AWS professionally for 6 years helped me in a lot of areas - particularly the well architected framework. Also, I loved my exam experience at re:Invent, compared to the typical exam centers we go to. It was far more relaxing, and I scored quite a bit of swag.</p>

<p>Here are the notes that I took while preparing for the exam.</p>

<p>From functions to containers to databases, serverless is a huge paradigm shift. The ability to only pay for what we use and not worry about underlying infrastructure is very tempting to developers and DevOps engineers, and the rate of innovation in this area has been very rapid across all major public cloud providers. Serverless architectures are the natural evolution of microservices design. While Lambda has become synonymous with serverless in AWS, there are several new and upcoming patterns that take serverless architectures to the next level.</p>

<p>Manish Pandit explains how to identify these patterns and put them to use. Using Marqeta’s efforts to move its payments infrastructure to the public cloud as an example, Manish explores the services that Marqeta considered, customized, hacked around, and successfully implemented as a part of this move.</p>
