<h2 id="ami">AMI</h2>

<p>An AMI, or Amazon Machine Image is a template that describes an instance - Operating System (Linux, Windows..), Architecture (i386, x86_64..), Virtualization (pvm, hvm), Block Device Mapping, Root Volume Type (EBS, Instance), and any other software packaged along. An AMI can be used to launch instances, usually in an Auto Scaling Group. An AMI is tied to a region, but can be copied over to other region(s). AMIs can be private (to an account), public, or shared across accounts. This privacy model controls which accounts can launch instances using this AMI. AMIs can be created from an instance via AWS CLI using the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-image.html" target="_blank_"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create-image</code></a> command.</p>

<h2 id="amis-and-immutable-deployments">AMIs and Immutable Deployments</h2>

<p>An AMI can be thought of as the lowest level of control for a deployment. Going up the chain, there are application servers, with application artifacts (RPM, WAR, node package) at the highest level. The goal is to achieve immutability by bundling the artifact in the AMI (<em>baking in</em>) so the instances created from this AMI would need no other configuration, and completely identical instances can be spun up in an automated manner. The logs on this instance can be monitored by pushing them out to a central logging service, such as Splunk or Loggly, or a home grown ELK setup. There should absolutely be no need to ssh into any of these instances.</p>

<h2 id="packer">Packer</h2>

<p><a href="https://packer.io" target="_blank_">Packer</a> is a tool to automate building of AMIs (and other targeted Machine Images) from configuration files, or <em>templates</em>. The templates are JSON files containing basic information about the AMI to be created, and can contain inline scripts to provision software on the resulting AMI. Any instances launched from this AMI will have the exact same configuration - from the Operating System to the deployed code. It is ideal to <em>not</em> have any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> access on these instances either to achieve a much higher, or absolute level of immutability. That may take a few iterations and maturity cycles though.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/lobster1234/helloworld-api" target="_blank_">Hello World SparkJava App</a>, which is created using the <a href="https://github.com/lobster1234/sparkjava-archetypes" target="_blank_">SparkJava WAR Maven archetype</a>. This WAR (versioned artifact) is available in github and will be <em>baked into</em> the AMI. We will use Jenkins to create an AMI for a release version of our war file.</p>

<p>In the real world, the WAR will be a real service, and the artifact would have been uploaded to Nexus or Artifactory after successfully passing pre-release test cycle. In this case, the war is available as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">release</code> in this github repo.</p>

<p>Download Packer from <a href="https://www.packer.io/downloads.html" target="_blank_">packer.io</a>. It would be ideal to have it run on your Jenkins node, as we will be using Jenkins to create an AMI.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash-3.2$ packer                               
Usage: packer [--version] [--help] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]

Available commands are:
   build       build image(s) from template
   fix         fixes templates from old versions of packer
   inspect     see components of a template
   push        push a template and supporting files to a Packer build service
   validate    check that a template is valid
   version     Prints the Packer version
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before creating the Jenkins job, it would help to take a look at a typical, basic Packer template. This file is located <a href="https://github.com/lobster1234/helloworld-api/blob/master/src/main/resources/packer.json" target="_blank_">here</a>.</p>

</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source_ami</code> I’ve used here is latest release <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2017.03</code> (at the time of writing) of Amazon Linux in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-east-1</code>. You can view the AMI IDs <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/" target="_blank_">here</a>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source_ami</code> is the base AMI - you may want to have a different base AMI for your company or project. In order to not think of this as a chicken and egg problem, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source_ami</code> can be <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html" target="_blank_">created from an EC2 instance</a>, which has the desired software and block mappings etc. on it.</p>

<p>In this case we will just use the bare bones Amazon Linux AMI to build the image. The type defines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EBS-backed-store</code> AMI in this case. Packer will build the AMI by creating an instance off of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source_ami</code>, run any installation scripts (to set up servers like Tomcat and deploying the WAR file), and register the image created after this process as a new AMI. The EC2 instance used to create the AMI will then be terminated by Packer.</p>

<p>All of this is defined under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">builders</code> section of the template, which can have multiple builders. We then use the template’s variable system to inject the artifact build version and timestamp in the created AMI name. In the real world, this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Build</code> variable will be a Jenkins parameter passed over by an upstream job.</p>

<p>Regarding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws_access_key</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws_secret_key</code> - these can be passed to the Jenkins job as parameters, or ideally be pre-configured on the Jenkins node under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.aws/credentials</code>. More details on Packer Templates <a href="https://www.packer.io/docs/templates/index.html" target="_blank_">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="provisioning-the-ami">Provisioning the AMI</h2>

<p>With the base AMI identified, we will need to install Tomcat, and deploy the WAR artifact in the AMI being created. This is achieved via a simple script, contained in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">provisioner</code> section in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packer.json</code>.</p>

<p>The script would do the following -</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download and install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenJDK8</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tomcat8</code></li>
  <li>Download the artifact (again, I am just using a simple git release here)</li>
  <li>Deploy it under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tomcat</code>, and make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tomcat</code> start on bootup</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we are ready to run packer via Jenkins, but let us validate the JSON first.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bash-3.2$ packer validate packer.json
Template validated successfully.

<h2 id="creating-the-jenkins-job-to-build-the-ami">Creating the Jenkins Job to build the AMI</h2>

<p>This is the job that gets triggered after pre-release tests have passed, and an artifact is ready to be pulled. This is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parameterized</code> build, and the parameter(s) will help it pull the correct artifact for the version being built.</p>

<p>We call the Jenkins Job <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello-world-api-packer</code>, created as a FreeStyle Project, pointed it to the git repo, and add the following under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Build/Execute Shell</code>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Downloads/packer build -var Build=$Build src/main/resources/packer.json</code></p>

<p>There is 1 string parameter, called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Build</code>. Please see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.xml</code> of this job in the References section below.</p>

<p>Once run, this is the job output -</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can see, the new AMI has been created with an ID <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ami-08fc671e</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">us-east-1</code> region. Since this AMI is private, It is visible under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">My AMIs</code> on the AWS Console.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/ami.png" alt="AMI" /></p>

<p>Upon selecting this AMI and launching an instance in a public subnet with a security group allowing TCP traffic to port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8080</code> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.0.0.0/0</code>, we can see the Tomcat landing page.</p>

<p>The resources below contain a fully functional pipeline - you’d need to configure <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank_">AWS CLI</a> on the Jenkins node, and place <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packer</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Downloads</code> folder on the node. You may want to change these paths if your folder structure is different.</p>

<p>Hope you found this tutorial useful, and can embark on the immutable deployment journey with Packer and AWS!</p>
