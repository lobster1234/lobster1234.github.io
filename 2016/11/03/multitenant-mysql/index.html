<!--more-->

<h2 id="use-a-tenant_id-for-each-record">Use a tenant_id for each record</h2>

<h4 id="how">How</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Single database running on single instance</li>
  <li>Every record has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tenant_id</code> as a part of the composite primary key.</li>
  <li>Application will need to provide this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tenant_id</code> for every query as a part of the where clause</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li>One database, one instance</li>
  <li>Relatively easy to run cross-tenant queries</li>
  <li>Relatively easier to manage and apply schema updates</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>No db level isolation of tenant data</li>
  <li>No option to support schema changes specific to a tenant</li>
  <li>Imbalance of tenants can adversely affect the DB performance, creating hotspots</li>
  <li>The sheer size and operation frequency increases the chances of db file corruption</li>
  <li>Will hit the file system size limits</li>
  <li>Trust the developer to provide the additional where condition</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="put-every-tenant-in-a-separate-db-same-instance">Put every tenant in a separate db, same instance</h2>

<h4 id="how-1">How</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Every tenant gets his schema, but runs under the same physical database server</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tenant_id</code> becomes the db name, so the queries do not change, but the connection string changes.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pros-1">Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Managable dataset size per tenant</li>
  <li>Better control of any schema changes specific to a tenant, if needed.</li>
  <li>DB level isolation of tenant data</li>
  <li>Easier to roll out tenant specific code release as other tenants wont be affected by schema changes if the app servers are deployed separately per tenant.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons-1">Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Will need to apply schema changes to all such DBs, making coordination of code changes harder if dedicated app servers talk to the db.</li>
  <li>Will hit the system file size limits, as it is still 1 physical file</li>
  <li>The fact that there is only 1 physical file, there could be IO contention just like 1 db per instance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="put-every-tenant-in-its-own-instance">Put every tenant in its own instance</h2>

<h4 id="how-2">How</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Every tenant gets a provisioned hardware mysql instance</li>
  <li>The code will need to use separate connection strings, no impact to SQL</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pros-2">Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Complete physical isolation of tenant data</li>
  <li>Control of the DB instance size based on the load exerted by the tenant</li>
  <li>Predictable Disk IO performance, due to isolation of data usage patterns</li>
  <li>Can have customized DB schema changes to a tenant</li>
  <li>Easier to roll out tenant specific code release (if dedicated app servers talk to a specific db)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="cons-2">Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each tenant DB instance is $$</li>
  <li>The cost quickly adds up with secondaries (standby) and read replicas if needed</li>
  <li>Same challenge with DB schema updates across all tenants</li>
</ul>
