    <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> is a great way to wrap Lambda functions as microservices exposed over HTTP/S, among many uses. However, any API Gateway endpoint is publically accessible. There are ways to restrict access using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/permissions.html">IAM</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html">Authorizers</a>, but for simple task of IP whitelisting was always somewhat challenging, if not downright hack-y.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/amazon-api-gateway-supports-resource-policies/">AWS announced Resource Policies</a> for API Gateway, which make IP whitelisting a breeze. This is extremely helpful for a company such as <a href="https://www.marqeta.com">mine</a>, as we deal with a lot of integrations that rely on IP whitelisting as one of the many layers of security. In this post I will walk through setting up IP whitelisting on an API hosted on API Gateway. We will use API Gateway’s built in Mock API feature to create a simple API, and secure it via IP Whitelisting.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="create-an-api">Create an API</h2>

<p>We will start by creating a mock API in API Gateway. Log on to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home?region=us-east-1#/apis/create">Amazon API Gateway</a> section on the console, and click to create a new API.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/create_new_api.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Next, create a new resource called <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello</code> by clicking <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actions/Create Resource</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/create_resource.png" alt="apipw-2" /></p>

<p>We will now add a method to this resource by clicking <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actions/Create Method</code> with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello</code> resource selected. We will pick <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/create_method_1.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>For this simple test, we’ll use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mock</code> integration for the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET /hello</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/create_method_2.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Here we can see the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> method created successfully.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/method_created.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Now, we can deploy this API. Amazon API Gateway deploys APIs as a part of a <em>stage</em>, so we get to create a stage as we deploy the API. Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actions/Deoply API</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/redeploy_api.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>You can pick any stage name, I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">dev</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/deploy_api.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Once deployed, you’ll see a stage editor, with the URL endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/invoke_url.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>This URL can be accessed as a public endpoint. The Mock API returns HTTP 200 when invoked.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ curl -i  https://wb6w08eb31.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/hello
HTTP/2 200
date: Sun, 15 Apr 2018 00:49:26 GMT
content-type: application/json
content-length: 0
x-amzn-requestid: d8ea6b1b-4046-11e8-97a5-4d3c440fb2a7
x-amz-apigw-id: FW4vhFdvoAMFRbQ=
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="whitelist-the-api">Whitelist the API</h2>

<p>We will set up a whitelist where it is only accessible from our IP address. You can use a service like <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/">whatsmyip</a> to get your IP address. If you’re like me and prefer command line, here it is -</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now we will whitelist this IP address. Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">Resource Policy</code> from the left menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/empty_resource_policy.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>We will now need the ARN of the API method to build a policy. To get the ARN, go back to the stage page, and copy the ARN of the method.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/copy_method_arn.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Once copied, replace the ARN and IP placeholders below with the method ARN and your IP address respectively.</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nt">"Version"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"2012-10-17"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

                        </span><span class="s2">"REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_IP"</span><span class="w">

    </span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>We now need to <em>redeploy</em> the API. Unlike IAM where policies take affect immediately, I could not see the Resource Policy behaving the same way.</p>

<p>Redeploy the API using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">dev</code> stage. This will not change the URL.</p>

<p><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/redeploy_after_change.png" alt="apipw-1" /></p>

<p>Thats it! The IP address is whitelisted. We can verify this via <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code>.</p>

<p>I used my wireless provider to check and ensure any other IP address is blocked from accessing the API. <em>Be sure to turn off the phone’s wifi if using this method.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://lobster1234.github.io/assets/apigw/blocked_url.jpeg" alt="apipw-1" height="50%" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can switch to a different network, or IM the URL to a friend who is not sharing the same network to verify.</p>

<h1 id="gotchas-and-tips">Gotchas and Tips</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Any changes to the Resource Policy will not reflect unless the API is redeployed as shown above.</li>
  <li>I could not find a way to attach the Resource Policy to the API in <a href="https://www.serverless.com">Serverless Framework</a>.</li>
  <li>The API Gateway Endpoints cannot be restricted to whitelist the VPC using this technique. The endpoints are still public, and they will only see the NAT Gateway EIP as the inbound request.</li>
  <li>If an EC2 instance is accessing the API, the API Gateway will use it’s Public IP to evaluate the resource policy.</li>
  <li>Wildcards can be used for the resource ARN in the policy, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">"Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:12345678900:*:*"</code> would apply the policy for all the API resources under the account ID <code class="highlighter-rouge">12345678900</code>.</li>
  <li>It does take a 30-60 seconds for the change to be reflected after deploying the API. Make sure you’re using incognito mode or curl to avoid any browser caching.</li>
  <li>The same example above can be used to blacklist IP addresses, by replacing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Allow</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deny</code>.</li>
</ol>
