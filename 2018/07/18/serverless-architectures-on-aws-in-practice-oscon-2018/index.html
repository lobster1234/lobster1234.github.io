  <title>Serverless Architectures on AWS in Practice</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Slides from my talk at OSCON 2018. From functions to containers to databases, serverless is a huge paradigm shift. The ability to only pay for what we use and not worry about underlying infrastructure is very tempting to developers and DevOps engineers, and the rate of innovation in this area has been very rapid across all major public cloud providers. Serverless architectures are the natural evolution of microservices design. While Lambda has become synonymous with serverless in AWS, there are several new and upcoming patterns that take serverless architectures to the next level. Manish Pandit explains how to identify these patterns and put them to use.
