    <p>At <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSreInvent/status/1068200715733020673">reInvent 2018</a>, AWS announced <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda Layers</a>, bringing Lambda construct closer to that of an AMI. Put simply, layers are dependencies that can be made available to the function at runtime. Currently there can be 5 <em>layers</em> associated with a function. Layers help with isolating common dependencies, as well as keeping the runtime consistent in terms of versions - just like the AMIs do. Layers are immutable, and are versioned. While this post is focused on Python, the concept of layers applies uniformly regardless of the language. The dependencies are zipped up, uploaded as new or a new version of an existing layer. They can be tied to runtimes for validation as well.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll walk through creating a Python layer, and associating it with a function. I’ll use the CLI, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell">aws-shell</a> to accomplish this.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In this walkthrough, we will associate the Python Github Client, <a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">PyGithub</a>, with a Layer, so it is available to our lambda function. I needed this for another project which will be blogged later.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ pwd
/Users/mpandit/work/pygithub
$ python --version
Python 2.7.10
$ pip install pygithub -t .
$ chmod -R 755 .
$ zip -r ../pygithub_layer.zip *

</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This will create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">pygithub_layer.zip</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Users/mpandit/work</code> folder. This archive has the layer that’d be uploaded to AWS.</p>

<p>Next, we will fire up AWS Shell to upload this Layer on AWS. We will add <code class="highlighter-rouge">_2_7</code> in the layer name to identify the version.</p>

<p>The above commands confirm that the layer is uploaded, and associated with the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">blogpublisher</code>. Now we can code the function and use the layer, which is made available to us at runtime.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">/opt/</code> to the path, as the runtime expands the layers in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/opt</code>. I could not get it to work without adding this, probably coz I am a Python n00b. There has to be a better way, but this works too.</p>

<p>You’ll need a Github personal access token with proper permissions, which can be created <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">here</a>.</p>
