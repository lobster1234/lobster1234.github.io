  <title>Securing your APIs with OAuth, OpenID, and OpenID Connect</title>
  <meta name="description" content="As products and companies move towards IoT model, users and machines alike need to interact with various APIs. Securing these APIs in a connected world can be a challenge faced by many. Fortunately, there are open standards addressing even the most complex of use cases - OAuth, OpenID and OpenID Connect happen to be widely adopted and have a growing support across many API and Identity Providers. In this session I’ll talk about these standards, and walk through common use cases/flows from an API Provider as well as consumer’s side. We will explore how these standards come together to not only secure the APIs, but also manage identity.">
